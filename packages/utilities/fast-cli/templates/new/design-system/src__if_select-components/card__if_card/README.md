# /* @echo namespace */-card
The `/* @echo namespace */-card` component is a visual container and design system provider. By default `/* @echo-namespace */-card` applies `neutralFillCard` to its background that is calculated from its parent design system provider. If a custom background color is desired the attribute `card-background-color` is available, this will reset the cards design system to that value. Cards are snapshots of content that are typically used in a group to present collections of related information.
